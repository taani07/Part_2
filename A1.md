### First Application: [SoundHound]

#### Link to application: [https://soundhound.com/soundhound/]

SoundHound is an Music finding app. This app is quite similar to its completive app Shazam but I prefer SoundHound over Shazam as I found this more convenient and appealing. This app particularly used to identify the songs and all the information related to that song like the artists, album and the lyrics etc. This app is very popular among the music lovers these days having 4.4 Star as a rating on play store and about 4M downloads over the year.

##### Description and Functionality:

How the app works is whenever you listen to any song in your surrounding but you don't know anything about that song you just need to open the app and tap on the "tap to SoundHound " option it will filter out the information within some seconds i,e the name of the songs, artists and also the album and displayed it. More than 1M people using/downloading this app every Month. Considering so many available apps in market the developer developed this app slightly different from others. The app has voice recognition system also You just need to say, “OK Hound” like Ok Google it will more like a virtual assistant play the music of your choice.

##### Why this application is chosen:
I choose this application because I found it different and novel enough. It used to happen with me quite often that I am sitting in any restaurant and they used to play some songs and I started liking that song, but I never went and asked what was that song playing because of my introvert nature but after using this app I found it very convenient in my case. Its impressive and simple GUI helps me in finding my own music on my own device.

##### What the buy in for the user is:
The users most preferably music lovers will love this app. Besides identifying the songs this apps provides the lyrics and all recommended songs of your favorite artists. It gives you all information about your favorite singers and songs.  The new version of this app also plays the songs offline, you need to stay connected to your data network all the time.

##### The combination of technology it leveraged:
The technology that been the app uses –
Cellular Data, Camera, and NFC.
HTML, CSS, Java Script with Java Query for Backend processing, MySQL for database and Ubuntu, Debian etc. for operating systems.

##### The type of Application:
This app is an Immersive type of application. As the app has multiple screens, have graphics and special effects.

 ##### The Strength and weakness of the application:

According to me the weak point of this application is this app should have its own music player, presently if user wants to hear the song of its choice or from its own playlist it should synced the application to the ‘Spotify’ or ‘Apple Music’.
And the strength of the app is its GUI which is quite user-friendly interface, and which makes it more efficient and convenient to use.

#### First Heuristic Evaluation: [Recognition Rather than Recall]

Are objects, Actions and options being always visible?
As per my analysis this app is fulfills this heuristic approach as on the main Screen of the app it has all options available on the lower bottom bar and these options will remain visible every time so that the user can go back to any screens they like.
 User’s can directly go back to the home screen, without going back to the previous menu.
Which indicates its functionality and redirect button to go back to the Home Screen user’s do need to Recall anything.
For example – If you are on ‘Play ‘and if you wish to go to your profile then you do need to press back button you can to your profile by clicking on ‘History Button’.



#### Second Heuristic Evaluation: [Help Users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors]
Sadly, but truly this app doesn’t follow this heuristic approach. This app does not provide any error message. Whenever you clicked on the play button the song will redirect you to the outside applications like ‘Spotify’ and ‘Apple Music’ and if u don’t have the account on these applications it will not show any error messages and still u won’t be able to hear or play the songs of your choice.
Hence this app doesn’t follow this approach. There is one more weakness is this app doesn’t provide any notifications neither any error messages.

#### First Heuristic Evaluation: [Visibility of System Status]

While using this app the user always gets the proper notification and messages. like while user click on any product to avail the offer there would be a button to add that offer while on the other hand it will also has messages listed under your products added like till what to what time you can availed this offer.

It provides user’s complete freedom to add any offer and at the same time remove the offer. Users can control the notification setting like it can be limited to daily and weekly basis. The app will provide you error messages if u will upload any receipt that is old and outside the duration of offers. Hence this app follows various heuristic approach like others Hence it has good rating on App store.
